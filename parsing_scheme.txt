LR(1) parsing

how do we handle function definitions?

ex:

i32 mn
	let x
	put x
	0



This becomes:

FnHeader, FnCall, Id, FnCall, Id, Int

How to lr1 reduce this

FnHeader, FnCall -> FnBody



How to distinguish between returning value and part of a fncall?

the biggest problem here is determining when a fncall ends.
how many arguments do we have and which ones do we expect?

if that's the case, we need to process all the fnheaders before we process the bodies.

returning value is the last value..
