go until we reach whitespace or until it can no longer be a token!
(also, if we reach a quote with no backslash before it, we continue until we find another quote, for strings. Or error if not.)

i32 -> Type
mn -> mn$
mn$ cannot be one token, so it is split
mn as ID
$ ID'd as type
args -> ID
put -> put"
put" cannot be one token, so it is split
put -> Fn

0 -> Value
